# How to run locally

1. [Download and install the .NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
    * If you don't have `localdb` available on your system, [Download and install SQL Server Express](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb)
    * NOTE: We will remove the `localdb` requirement in a future PR
2. Open a terminal such as **PowerShell**, **Command Prompt**, or **bash** and navigate to the `service` folder
3. Run the following `dotnet` commands:
```sh
dotnet build
dotnet run --project Microsoft.DSX.ProjectTemplate.API
```
3. Open your browser to: `https://localhost:44345/swagger`.
4. In another terminal, navigate to the `client` folder and run the following `npm` commands:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
5. The webpack dev server hosts the front-end and your browser will open to: `http://localhost:3000`
